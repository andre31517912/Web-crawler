How to run my project:

Main things to note:

In the indexer.py ---> Line 28 it is mandatory the filename is changed so that it creates the file in your computer not with the file path that exists on my computer

To run the code:
    Change the file path to one where you want to write the index to in indexer.py 
    It will create the indexer to file and does it every time 15 elements have been added

    then go to the search and run the code and it will give you the chance to run 10 queries BUT MAKE SURE THE FILE PATH IS CHANGED TOO ON LINE  69 in search.py as it loads the postings of the inverted index it needs
    After you search the query it will give a dictionary with key being the url its in and the value being the ranked score and it is sorted in decreasing order


20 queries I chose to test out my algorithm were:

10 very easy queries
'communications'
'relate'
'health'
'walk'
'on'
'meltzer'
'introduce'
'testing'
'transportation'
'geospatial',


10 queries on the more difficult side
 'sharada member whether',
 'gee sam book', 
 'cranstoun mobile'
 'intersection finish encrypted'
 'panagiotis', 
 'cathal carolyn' 
 'alsubaiee laboratories'
 'collection just'
 'chennegative programs timeline'
  'claudia models edward'
